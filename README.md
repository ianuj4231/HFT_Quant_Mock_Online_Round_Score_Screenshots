The aim of this mock online round/test is to solve 80 mental arithmetic questions within 8 minutes. In my fourth attempt at the mock online round/test for the Optiver, I scored 74/80 marks, which came from correctly answering 77 questions out of a total of 80 questions (+1 for each correct response and a  -2 penalty for each wrong answer).
